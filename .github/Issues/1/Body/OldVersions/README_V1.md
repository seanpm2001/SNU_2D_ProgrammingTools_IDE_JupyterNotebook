### Jupyter notebook demo incomplete (2 files couldn't be uploaded)

Today (Wednesday, December 9th 2020) I started to add support for Jupyters Notebook with documentation and samples. Unfortunately, 2 of the sample files from the demo couldn't be uploaded due to file size issues.

The following is a listing of the 2 files I couldn't upload:

1. `big.csv` - Size: `182.6 MiB`

2. `all_thresholded.by_genes.txt` - Size: `32.5 MiB`

I won't upload these files unless the upload limit is raised.
